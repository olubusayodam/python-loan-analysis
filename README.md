# Loan Prediction Analysis Using Python
This project aims to predict loan approval status based on various features using Python programming language. It involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, machine learning model building, and evaluation.
## Overview

The loan prediction analysis project involves the following steps:

1. Data loading and exploration to understand the dataset's structure and contents.
2. Data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between different features.
4. Building machine learning models for loan prediction using algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), or decision trees.
5. Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics and techniques.
The dataset used in this project contains information about loan applicants, including attributes such as gender, marital status, education, income, loan amount, loan term, credit history, and property area. It consists of both numerical and categorical features
